# Forex Signal Engine

Automated **Forex scanner + signal dashboard**. The system ingests market data,
runs it through a strictly ordered decision pipeline, and emits explainable
trade signals.

> **Status: Phase 0 - Project Initialization complete.**
> Trading logic is intentionally minimal. No broker integration, no live
> trading, no backtesting yet. Those arrive in later phases.

## Pipeline

```text
Market Data -> Structure -> Regime -> Bias -> Setup -> Trigger -> Risk -> Execution
```

Every stage is explainable: each decision carries the reasons that produced it.
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the responsibility of each layer.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js** (App Router) + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **ESLint** for linting
- **Vitest** + **Testing Library** for tests
- PostgreSQL + Prisma and TradingView Lightweight Charts are planned for later
  phases and are **not** installed yet.

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local   # then edit .env.local
# (Windows PowerShell: Copy-Item .env.example .env.local)

# 3. Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The placeholder dashboard
reports the current system status.

## Development commands

| Command              | Description                                  |

| `npm run dev`        | Start the development server                 |
| `npm run build`      | Production build                             |
| `npm run start`      | Serve the production build                   |
| `npm run lint`       | Run ESLint                                   |
| `npm run typecheck`  | Run `tsc --noEmit` (no JS output)            |
| `npm test`           | Run the test suite once                      |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode                      |

## Project structure

```text
src/
  app/              Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  components/        React components (UI only - no trading logic)
  config/           System and feature configuration
  core/              Trading engine pipeline (decision logic)
    execution/       Execution decision gate (Phase 1: SIGNAL ONLY)
  lib/               Small shared helpers
  types/             Shared domain types (provider-agnostic)
tests/               Test suite mirroring the source tree
```

`src/providers/`, `src/scanner/`, `src/backtesting/`, and `src/paper-trading/`
are part of the target architecture but are intentionally **not** created yet.
They appear in later phases, each with real content rather than as empty folders.

## Engineering principles

- **Modular** - one responsibility per module, no god files.
- **Strongly typed** - shared domain types are the contract between layers.
- **Testable** - engine logic is pure functions, easy to unit test.
- **Provider-agnostic** - market data is normalized before engines see it.
- **Explainable** - every decision records why it was made.
- **Separated concerns** - trading logic never lives in React components; market
  data providers and broker integration stay independent of the engine.

## Scope guardrails

The Execution Engine currently only decides between `WAIT`, `EXECUTE`,
`BLOCKED`, and `INVALIDATED`. It does **not** send orders. Live trading,
backtesting, paper trading, economic calendar, fundamentals, and notification
channels (Telegram/WhatsApp/email) are out of scope until explicitly requested.
